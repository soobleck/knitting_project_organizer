# knitting_project_organizer
Converts knitting pattern PDFs into lists of stitches/row and a count of remaining stitches.

# To Do:
  - Create code to get number of stitches (total, remaining, already completed).
  - Create child classes of Pattern for Hat, Scarf, Sweater, etc.
  - Source a simple knitting pattern with different sizes (hat?).
  - Create code to modify size as user input.
  - Create code to parse knitting charts.

# Completed:
  - Create .gitignore to ignore any copywritten PDFs.
  - Create folder of example patterns to analyze.
  - Source a one-size-fits-all, small knitting pattern (scarf?).
  - Create code to parse the PDF.
  - Create code to eliminate any filler text.
  - Create code to match our gold format.
  - Create code to parse the pattern string.
