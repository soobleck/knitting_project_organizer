# knitting_project_organizer
Converts knitting pattern PDFs into lists of stitches/row and a count of remaining stitches.

# To Do:
  - Prepare gold format of one-size-fits-all, small knitting pattern string as example (scarf?).
  - Create code to parse the PDF.
  - Create code to eliminate any filler text.
  - Create code to match our gold format.
  - Create code to parse the pattern string.
  - Create code to get number of stitches (total, remaining, already completed).
  - Prepare gold format of knitting pattern with different sizes (hat?).
  - Create code to modify ``size'' as user input.
  - Create code to parse knitting charts.

# Completed:
  - Create .gitignore to ignore any copywritten PDFs.
  - Create folder of example patterns to analyze.
