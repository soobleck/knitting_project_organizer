# knitting_project_organizer
Converts knitting pattern PDFs into lists of stitches/row and a count of remaining stitches.

# To Do:
  1. Create .gitignore to ignore any copywritten PDFs.
  2. Create folder of example patterns to analyze.
  3. Prepare gold format of one-size-fits-all, small knitting pattern string as example (scarf?).
  4. Create code to parse the PDF.
  7. Create code to eliminate any filler text.
  8. Create code to match our gold format.
  5. Create code to parse the pattern string.
  6. Create code to get number of stitches (total, remaining, already completed).
  7. Prepare gold format of knitting pattern with different sizes (hat?).
  9. Create code to modify ``size'' as user input.
  10. Create code to parse knitting charts.
